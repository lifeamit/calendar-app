Must Before Deliver


Good to have
- highlight current date
- make it look good
- error in fetch events



Edge cases:
- semantic html
- util classes in a separate file
- unit tests
- what to do when there are thousands of events to render
- make sure it runs in all the browsers
- all the components should have prop types and default props
- accessibility
- needs to look good on mobile too



Unit Test Cases
---------------------
- Calendar should render [navigation, grid]
- Should render some event in at least one cell
- Prev/Next should work
